Flappy-Nerds
============

Written for the Great Uni Hackathon (at the University of Manchester) 8/3/14

This is a (satirically named) version of the infamous "Flappy Birds" that we built from scratch using C# and XNA. It makes use of the Kinect sensor as the control mechanism (this is currently required to play the game). All artwork was made by @audreyleowhl.
