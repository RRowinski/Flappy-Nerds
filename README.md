Flappy-Nerds
============

Written for the 8 hour Great Uni Hackathon (at the University of Manchester) on 8/3/14. This entry won the Ebuyer Game Dev prize.

This is a (satirically named) version of the infamous "Flappy Birds" that we built from scratch using C# and XNA. It makes use of the Kinect sensor as the control mechanism (this is currently required to play the game). All artwork was made by audreyleowhl. Coding was done by dan-c-underwood, geminicru and RRowinski.
